        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>By cooking the eggs to form a soufflé, the meal is soft, springy and bouncy. However, once you eat it, it melts in your mouth, just like magic! However, be warned, it must be served quickly before it loses its form.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>2 tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp granulated consomme</li>
            <li>3 tbsp red wine</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>diced parsley</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the tomatoes and finely chop the garlic</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and saute the garlic. Once it smells fragrant, add the tomatoes and saute them until tender</li>
            <li>Add the consomme and red wine and simmer on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or it has reduced by half</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, crack the eggs into a bowl and thoroughly whip with an electric mixer until it’s thick enough that when you scoop up the mixture and let it drizzle, ripples remain on the surface</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and add half of the mixture</li>
            <li>Cook on medium heat for about one minute, and then turn off the heat. Cover it, and let it steam for one minute. Fold it in half and plate. Repeat for the other half of the mixture</li>
            <li>Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste, and pour it over the omelet. Garnish with parsley, and you’re done</li>
        </ol>
